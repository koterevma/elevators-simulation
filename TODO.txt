Write 2 simulation of elevators in a building and compare them

1st simulation is N={1-6} elevators with simple logic

2nd simulation is N={1-6} elevators with more complex customizable logic (more details below)
    1. We know the summary weight of people standing on the first floor
    2. We know the max capaity of each elevator

Plan:
    1. Think how the simulation will be calculated
        1.1. There is a global time variable and it's incrementing by a STEP value
        1.2. Then .calculate_to(global_time) method is called and simulation
             state will represent a state at this moment 
        1.3. Redraw a state according to data stored in Simulation class
